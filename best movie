The best movie i saw this summer was young offenders. which is a light hearted comedy about two teenage freinds in ireland. They come up with the idea to find cocaine from a shipwreck that was carrying it to sell it for money with the belif that if things go wrong they are young offenders and can't be arrested. The 2 teens have been living not great lifes with ine of them getting into fight with his father who has been stealing money from him. He also is being followed by a cop becuase he wears a mask of someone in prison and he rides on a bike to break the law. the other one who the story follows he dosent really want to break the law and he works with his mother selling fish. i liked it becuase it was funny.
